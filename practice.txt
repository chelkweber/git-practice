This week… I had the least amount of sleep in a long, long time. 
I learned a lot and had so much support. I listened to a lot of podcasts on my commute. I rediscovered Detroit’s downtown area. I carpooled and got to know Autumn really well. This weekend I supposed to be really nice out. Spring is finally here! It’ll make studying outside really exciting. I hope the weather is terrible so I am stuck inside and have to sit at the computer instead of working in the yard and getting beautiful sunshine. I have nothing more to write. I am excited for a Friday night, and may go out for dinner, yhuuuuus.
